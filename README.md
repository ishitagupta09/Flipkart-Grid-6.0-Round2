# Flipkart Inventory - Smart Quality Test System
# Overview
The Flipkart Inventory project aims to automate the quality and quantity testing of shipments using advanced camera vision technology and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging deep learning models, the system efficiently processes images to evaluate product freshness, read labels and expiry dates via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and identify brands through image recognition, all with the goal of achieving over 95% accuracy.
# Key Features
1. Freshness Detection: Identifies the freshness of fruits, vegetables, and other perishable products based on visual cues using computer vision.
2. OCR for Labels: Extracts and reads labels, expiry dates, and other important text from packaging through Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
3. Brand Recognition: Uses image-based recognition to identify product brands to ensure proper handling during shipment processing.
4. Real-time Quality & Quantity Testing: The system is designed to handle and analyze products on a conveyor belt in real-time, with a focus on reducing human error and increasing efficiency in quality testing.
# Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to achieve over 95% accuracy in detecting freshness, reading expiry dates, and performing brand recognition. The system is being developed for Flipkart's inventory management and quality control workflows, aiming to enhance automation and streamline shipment processing.
# Technologies Used
1. Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras for model training and inference.
2. Computer Vision: OpenCV for image processing and real-time object detection.
3. OCR: Tesseract OCR for extracting text from product labels.
4. Backend: Python, Flask for the API.
5. Frontend: React for the user interface (if applicable).
6. Hardware: Conveyor belt system with integrated cameras for product analysis.
